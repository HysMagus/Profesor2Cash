If you get stuck, don't hesitate to open an issue or message me on Twitter [@stephancill](https://twitter.com/stephancill)

## TODO
* [x] OCR for tweets with pictures
* [ ] Set default amount to buy in config
* [ ] Timed orders (e.g. sell after 30 min)
* [ ] General order management (/neworder)

## How it works
A stream is configured to listen to new tweets by user IDs specified in `config.json`. When it receives a tweet, it checks if any coins that trade on Bittrex are mentioned, analyzes the overall sentiment and determines which coins you should buy. The Telegram bot then sends you a message with those buying options and allows you to inspect a market summary of all the buying options. Along with the market summary, it provides you with a button that you can press to buy the coin on Bittrex and asks you to specify how much (in BTC) you would like to spend and places a buy order at the asking price.

### Why not just automatically buy? [Deprecated Reasoning but Valid Premise]
McAfee doesn't only tweet the coin of the day. A Telegram bot is merely a conservative approach to prevent the bot from making stupid trades. E.g.
